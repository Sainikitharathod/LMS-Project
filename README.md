## LMS-Project
The Learning Management System (LMS) project is a full-stack web application designed to simplify and manage online education processes.
It supports multiple user roles — Admin, Trainer, and Student — each with dedicated functionalities to make the system scalable and maintainable.

This LMS is built with:

Frontend: React.js → for an interactive and responsive user interface.

Backend: Spring Boot → for building RESTful APIs, handling business logic, and connecting with the database.

## Project Objectives:
Build a modular and role-based LMS that can be extended easily.

Provide a clean UI for each user role: Admin, Trainer, and Student.

Learn and apply full-stack development skills: React, REST APIs, and Spring Boot.

Practice integrating frontend and backend and deploying a real-world-like project.

## Main Functionalities:
1.Admin Dashboard

Login securely (using email and employee ID).

Add new trainers.

View the list of trainers (active/inactive status).

Manage overall users and monitor system data.

 2.Trainer Dashboard
 
Add new assignments for students (MCQs, programs, or both).

View, edit, and delete existing assignments.

Track the status of assignments.

Manage courses and subjects related to their role.

3.Student Panel

View available courses and assignments.

Submit completed assignments.

Track their own progress and status.

# Why this project is important (and what I learned):

Learned to design a full-stack architecture: separate frontend and backend, communicate via REST APIs.

Gained experience in React (routing, hooks, components).

Practiced Spring Boot development: REST APIs, JPA, services.

Improved understanding of role-based access and modular code.

Applied Git and GitHub for version control and project organization.

** Conclusion **:
-------------------
This LMS project demonstrates the practical implementation of a modern full-stack application by integrating a React.js frontend with a Spring Boot backend.
It showcases essential features like role-based dashboards, modular architecture, and seamless communication between client and server through RESTful APIs.

Building this project strengthened my understanding of frontend-backend integration, component-driven development, and scalable backend design using industry-standard frameworks.
It also gave me hands-on experience with Git, version control, and organizing a clean, maintainable project structure.

This is an ongoing project, and I plan to enhance it further by adding advanced features such as analytics dashboards, notifications, and production deployment.
I believe this LMS can serve as a strong foundation for a real-world learning platform and reflects my dedication to writing clean, modular, and efficient code.
